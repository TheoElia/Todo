# Todo
This is a tutorial web application, it caters for most principles in Django for building a modern web application using Django. Building APIs using Django's in-built method instead of using another library, calling APIs from javascript. These make this app a decoupled one, meaning, one with an independent front end and an independent back end in most cases.

Have Fun!
