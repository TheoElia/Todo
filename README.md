# Todo
This is a tutorial web application, it caters for most principles in Django for building a modern web application using Django. Building APIs using Django's in-built method instead of using another library, calling APIs from javascript. These make this app a decoupled one, meaning, one with an independent front end and an independent back end in most cases.

# Instruction
First clone the project unto your machine, git clone project_url_here should help you do that.
After that, change directory into the project folder, cd Todo for example.
And then run the following to make sure you have installed all requirements:
pip install -r requirements.txt
or 
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

After everything is installed, excute this command.

python manage.py runserver
or
python3 manage.py runserver

Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/app/ in the browser on the same machine as the one you have done all of the above on. Voila!


Have Fun!
