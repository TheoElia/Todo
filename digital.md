# Why go digital?
Most of us here own businesses, most being start ups.
If you look up the definition for startup you get this:

A startup is a young company founded by one or more entrepreneurs to develop a unique product or service and bring it to market. By its nature, the typical startup tends to be a shoestring operation, with initial funding from the founders or their friends and families.

In view of the fact that, most of us own or are a part of a startup,
I've decided to focus on why we need to go digital as a business?

Let me go straight to the reasons.

## It is cheap
Going digital is extremely cheaper compared to the old way doing business.
For example, if you made a flyer 100 cedis worth of designign,
you do not need to print for another 100 cedis and walk under the hot sun
pasting it around, you just need to share on social media, for FREE.

That's just one scenario

## Creating connections.

As our brand strategist, Jerry has always noted, we need our brand to connect to our customers. Now, in an age where everyone hold some
device, is on Instagram, Facebook and other social media platforms,
what do you think? How else do you connect to your customers?

You have customers who do not look at the world around them, it's
the hard truth, their attention is fixated on their devices,
it means in order to connect with these people, you need to find 
a way into their devices, a way to still connect.

Gone are the days when you had to spend so much branding (painting,
usually) your shop for people to feek attracted and enter.

Now, the colors are free.


## Remaining visible

That leads to remaining visible in a world that has moved from physical
to virtual. 
With the emergence of Covid-19, which we cannot finish a conversation
without, everyone realized what we have been making noise about, going 
almost completely virtual.
As a startup owner, or a member of a startup group, if you wish 
to make your business thrive then you surely need to keep up with the trend of going virtual, I can assure you, if you want to sell,
then do not get missing just because times have changed, change as well,
keep up with the trend.

I will give you some ways that you can actually go virtual before the session ends.

## The Menu Cost is no longer here.

In economics, a menu cost is the cost to a firm resulting from changing its prices. The name stems from the cost of restaurants literally printing new menus, but economists use it to refer to the costs of changing nominal prices in general.

Let me make a point with the menu cost theory, the menu cost theory
exists because as defined above, it was used to referred to 
businesses having to literally re print all their menu when there 
are price changes, if business begun from our time, menu cost would
sound like "nonsense".

Well, that's because, physical menus and printing will almost be a
foreign concept.

What I'm saying here is, your business should be looking towards
that part of digitization, cashless transactions, paperless contracts,
menus that can change like stock prices based on market behavior.

You cannot do this with the physical papers, you can absolutely do
this with digitization, imagine you had a system that knew how the 
market is behaving and automatically adjusted your prices.

Well, that's no longer just an idea, it's highly possible.The Menu Cost is no longer here.

## Taking advantage of Africa's advancement in Tech
We usually compare Africa to Europe and the Americas, we usually think
we are behind in everything. Well, let me open your eyes to MoMo,
MoMo is one advancement in Tech that makes Africa way ahead of all
other continents when it comes to money transactions.

This happened because of our problem of illteracy, this problem
turned into a blessing when Momo was introduced. Making Africa
the most advance in money transactions. Why don't you take
advantage of this? 

Go cashless with your business, move money around as much as you need.

I have never stepped in my bank after I went to take my Visa Card,
that was my first and last time stepping in my bank,
I do all my transaction, business and personal from my bed.


## Security
I will like to move on to how we can digitize our business but before
that, let's talk security.

I believe that the safest way to keep your money, and records of it
is to make sure they are digital. Almost undestroyable.

Your money becomes a set of inregers on your phone and that's all,
no one attacks you for it, well, a cyber attacker needs to be
too smart to actually rob you of your money.

It is also easier keeping records.

For example, if you were recording with books and then a customer
came back to review a 2 months old transaction, you are in trouble.

If the record is digital, 5 seconds is too much time to pull it out.

This makes your business even more trusted

# How to digitize

## Getting a website, SEO
"If itâ€™s not on Google, it does not exist" -- This was from a survey

If customers cannot find your business when the type it in Google,
you need to sit up, because to them, it means you do not exist. 

Get a website, you could easily design one yourself, it's not that 
difficult, if it's very complex, contact a developer like me.

Make sure your site obeys most of the Search

## Blogging

Another online marketing strategy is creating and maintaining a blog.  The thing about blogs is they are simple, engaging and easily builds connection with consumers.  They offer a creative way of providing information with reviews and testimonials and encourage discussion and comments from readers and customers.  By blogging on a regular basis, brand connections are strengthened.  Blog marketing helps your business become a trusted source of information.


## Make use of apps
There is almost an app for everything, an app to organize your tasks,
an app to keep records, an app to do that and this, there's
even an app that reminds you to drink water.

That's our world, get relevant apps on your device for your business,
make your own life easier that way.

## Digital Adverts

The reason why social media is free is this:
The owners want a lot of people to use it, so that they can later
advertise the users' brands to one another and get paid.

Millions of people are glued to their devices as I mentioned ealier,
use social media adverts to get to them, they will most likely see your
brand, and repeately seeing your brand pushes something in them:
"Let me try and see"

Learn about using hashtags and tagging the right people, and you 
are good to go.

# Digitization has some dangers

## Cyber Fraud

Be smart out there, do not give out your password anyhow,
not even to the creators of the application or system you are using
unless (almost won't happen) you are so sure they need it.

Read the privacy policy of sites and applications you use.

You do not need to read all of it, skip to how they handle your 
data, how they store your password, if you hear that they hash
your password, then you are quite safe. If they do not, please
make sure you do not use a password that you use on another site
if you ansolutely need their software, or look for a similar 
app to use.

Thank you for participating, the floor is opened for questions.
